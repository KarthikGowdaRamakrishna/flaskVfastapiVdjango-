## Steps:

### Installation

```console
pip install Django
django-admin startproject todoapp
```

### Start

```console
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
python manage.py startapp todolist
```

- add 'todolist' to INSTALLED_APPS

### Add views
- implement todolist.views.py and create todolist.urls.py
- add urls to todoapp.urls.py

### Add templates
- add templates folder and file
- add "templates" to DIR in settings.py
- modify view: return render...

### Add models
- implement todolist.models.py

### Put together
```console
manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

- Adding models to the administration site:
    - todolist.admin.py: admin.site.register(Todo)
- login to admin

### add template
- add {% csrf_token %} to template

### CRUD
- implement views


This document highlights the core features of Django that empower the development and functionality of the Django To-Do application. Django, a high-level Python web framework, encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. This To-Do application leverages Django's robust features to provide a user-friendly task management system.

## Core Features of Django Utilized in the To-Do Application

### 1. ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)

Django's ORM is a powerful tool for database interaction. It allows for the definition of data models in Python, which are then translated into database tables. This abstraction layer facilitates data creation, retrieval, update, and deletion operations without the need for raw SQL queries.

In the To-Do application, tasks are represented as models, making it easy to interact with task-related data.

```python
from django.db import models

class Task(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField()
    completed = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

### 2. Admin Interface

Django's auto-generated admin interface is a powerful feature for site administrators. It provides a ready-to-use interface for managing the application's content and users. In the context of the To-Do application, the admin interface allows for the management of tasks and user accounts, offering an intuitive UI for database operations.

### 3. URL Routing

Django's URL dispatcher allows for the design of clean, elegant URLs, which is crucial for a good web application structure. URL patterns are defined in a Python module, making URL changes easy and not tied to the application's design.

For the To-Do application, URL routing is used to direct HTTP requests to the appropriate view functions, handling tasks like displaying, creating, updating, and deleting tasks.

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.task_list, name='task-list'),
    path('task/<int:id>/', views.task_detail, name='task-detail'),
    # Other URL patterns...
]
```

### 4. Template Engine

Django's template engine allows for dynamic HTML generation. Templates define placeholders and template tags, which get replaced with actual data when the template is rendered. This separation of HTML structure from Python code makes it easier to design and maintain the application's frontend.

In the To-Do application, templates are used to render task lists, task detail pages, and forms for task creation and editing.

### 5. Forms and Validation

Django forms handle the rendering of HTML form elements and the validation of submitted form data. This feature simplifies the tasks of data collection and validation, ensuring data integrity for the application.

The To-Do application uses Django forms to facilitate task creation and updates, providing a user-friendly interface for input and ensuring the validity of the data stored in the database.

### 6. Security

Django includes numerous built-in security features that help developers avoid common security mistakes, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery, and clickjacking. Its user authentication system provides a secure way to manage user accounts and passwords.

The To-Do application benefits from Django's security features, ensuring that task data is protected and that user interactions are secure.

## Conclusion

The Django To-Do application exemplifies how Django's features can be leveraged to build a robust, efficient, and secure web application. From its ORM and admin interface to its URL routing, template engine, forms, and security features, Django provides all the tools necessary to build and manage a comprehensive To-Do application.
