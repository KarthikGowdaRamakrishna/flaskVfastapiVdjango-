# Flask vs FastAPI vs Django: Performance Analysis

Welcome to the GitHub repository for "Flask vs FastAPI vs Django: Performance Analysis". This project is aimed at providing an in-depth comparative analysis of three major Python web frameworks: Flask, FastAPI, and Django. The goal is to evaluate these frameworks based on various performance metrics, ease of use, scalability, and feature set, to help developers make informed decisions when choosing a web framework for their projects.

## Project Overview

Python, being a versatile programming language, offers multiple frameworks for web development, each with its unique features and use cases. To analyzes Flask, FastAPI, and Django, focusing on:
- Response time
- Scalability
- Ease of setup and use
- Community support and ecosystem
- Suitability for different types of projects

## Developed a simple To-do application to better understand this aspects in a very baseline level with simple CRUD opreation and Database sqlite setup
## below are the results of Data analysis & visualizations comparing Flask, Django, and FastAPI across various metrics

## brief summary of the insights from each plot:

1. **Response Time (ms):** FastAPI tends to have lower response times, indicating faster server responses compared to Flask and Django.
2. **Throughput (req/sec):** FastAPI also shows higher throughput, meaning it can handle more requests per second, which is crucial for high-load applications.
3. **CPU Usage (%):** CPU usage varies, with FastAPI generally showing lower CPU consumption, suggesting more efficient resource usage.
4. **Memory Usage (MB):** FastAPI appears to be more memory-efficient, with lower memory usage than Flask and Django.
5. **Error Rate (%):** FastAPI has a lower error rate, indicating higher reliability or more effective error handling in the sample operations.
6. **Development Time (mins):** Development time is somewhat varied, but Django shows a tendency towards shorter development times, possibly due to its more extensive built-in features.
7. **Lines of Code:** Django often requires more lines of code, which might be due to its "batteries-included" approach, offering more built-in functionalities that, while comprehensive, can lead to more verbose codebases.
8. **Developer Satisfaction (1-10):** Developer satisfaction is highest with FastAPI, suggesting that its performance, ease of use, or features are particularly appreciated.
